This command is used to gain information about a person or objects
aura that can not be found by just looking at them. For people it can
reveal the state of their magic, their grade, the location of any implants
and much more. For objects it can tell you their magical purpose, ratings
and who bonded them. 
If you are assenssing a person and put the word spell
after their name, you will assense the auras of any spells cast on that
person instead of their personal aura.
You can also assense a piece of equipment someone is wearing by specifying
the equipment name after the name of the person.
