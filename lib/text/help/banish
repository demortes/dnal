BANISH

Usage: ^gBANISH <spirit/elemental>^n
       ^gBANISH^n

This command is used to banish a spirit or elemental back to
the metaplanes, completely removing then from the physical and
astral planes. Once initiated only the person who won the last
round of banishing can stop it. You pit your conjuring skill against
the force of the spirit, if you are the summoner then your Charisma
also plays a part. If the spirit wins, your magic is temporarily
reduced and if it is reduced to 0 you are liable to pass out.
A Shaman or Mage can banish any type of spirit or elemental.
Typing the banish command on it's own will stop the contest if you
currently are in control.
