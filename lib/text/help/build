This command is used to build a variety of items. First, Cyberdeck
parts must be built into a deck that has been created using the create
command. You must have the correct amount of parts and chips for the
part and any software that is needed. The parts and chips can be found
in the create part menu. 
Lodge is for creating shamanic lodges, this lodge is automatically
dedicated to your totem and bound to you once completed.
Hermetic circles are used for conjuring elementals and can only
be dedicated to a single elemental.
Only one lodge or hermetic circle can be in a room at a time.
All of these actions take time to complete.
