CASTING CAST

Usage: ^gCAST [force] <spell name> [damage level] [target]^n

There are many different ways to use that cast command. Careful
reading of this help file is recommended.

Force is the force you wish to cash the spell at, this is optional.
Leaving this value out will mean you cast the spell at the maximum
force you know. You cannot cast a spell at a force high than you know
it.

The spell name can either be typed as one word on its own, or as multiple
words in quotes. Refer to the examples at the bottom of the file for
more help.

Damage level is only used in spell that cause damage. You have the
choice of the standard Shadowrun damage levels of Light, Moderate,
Serious and Deadly. This affects how much damage the spell does and
also how much drain you take.

The target of the spell can be any valid target, not all spells require
a target.

Here are some examples:

^c< 10P 10M > cast 3 Invisibility self^n
This will cast the spell Invisibility at a force of 3 on yourself.

^c< 10P 10M > cast 3 "Improved Invisibility" self^n
This will cast the spell Improved Invisibility at a force of 3 on yourself.

^c< 10P 10M > cast light^n
The light spell doesn't require a target, so using this syntax is fine.

^c< 10P 10M > cast manabolt serious lonestar^n
This will cast the manabolt spell at a Lone Star officer with a base damage
of Serious.
