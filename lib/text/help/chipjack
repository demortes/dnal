SKILLWIRES SKILLSOFTS CHIPJACK

Chipjacks are cyberware designed for the sole purpose of slotting
various chips into. They can take skillsofts, optical memory chips
or BTLs. Skillsofts for active skills also require skillwires to use,
this defines the maximum rating also, as no active skillsoft can be
of a rating higher than the skillwires. Skillsofts for language
and knowledge skills aren't affected by skillwires however.
