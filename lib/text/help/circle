"HERMETIC CIRCLE"

Hermetic circles, along with conjuring libraries, are used by hermetic
mages to summon elementals to do their bidding. They are dedicated to a
specific element and cannot be used to summon an elemental of any other
time, and they cannot be used to summon an elemental greater than the force
of the circle.
While summoning an elemental the mage is protected by an astral barrier
equal to the force of the hermetic circle.
Only one lodge or hermetic circle can be present in a room at any given time.
