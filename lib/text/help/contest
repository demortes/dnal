CONTEST

Usage: ^gCONTEST <spirit/elemental>^n

This command is used to contest control of a spirit or elemental
bound by another awakened person. You pit your conjuring skill
against your opponents and the winner comes away with control of
the spirit/elemental. You will take drain wether you succeed or fail
the test, but if you win, the spirit/elemental will be under your
control. Only hermetic mages can contest elementals and only shamanic
mages can contest nature spirits.
