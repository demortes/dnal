COPYOVER
A copyover is a way of rebooting the MUD without having to disconnect players.
It works by "freezing" all the people connected to it, then fires up another instance
of the server and copies all of the connections over. It allows us to update the MUD
with minimal disruptance to playesr. The only downsides are that it resets all runs
and all items on the floor outside of apartments and storage rooms are lost.
