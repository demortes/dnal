DESIGN

Usage: ^gDESIGN <part/program>^n

This command creates a program design which helps with your
programming tests later in the development cycle. This takes
a number of hours equal to the program rating multiplied by
the program size multiplier. You must have the program
installed on a desktop computer and be sitting in the room
to use this. You must also have the applicable program
design skill.
This is also used to create a part design for building cyberdeck
components. Again, it helps your building test later in
the construction cycle. Not all parts requiring designing.
