DISPELL

This command is used to dispell a spell effect that has been cast
on a person, or an area affect spell if you know who the caster is.
You must assense the person to find out the number of the spell in the
persons spell affection list. You then pit your sorcery skill and spell 
casting pool against the force of the spell you wish to dispell, and 
will either weaken it or completly dispell it, depending on your skill.
Each time you try an dispell a spell you face drain as though you had 
just cast the spell you are trying to dispell.
