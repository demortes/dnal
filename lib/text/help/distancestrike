"DISTANCE STRIKE"

This allows to adept to strike from a distance, meaning they don't
have to close as much distance to attack in hand to hand combat.
This does not allow to to negate closing all together it just reduces
the ammount of distance they need to close. It works at a range equal
to the user's magic rating in meters.
