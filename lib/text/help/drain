DRAIN

Usage: ^gDRAIN <dice>^n

The drain command is used to allocate spell pool dice to the
drain resistance test instead of the spell casting test. Any
dice allocated to the drain test will not be available for the
spell casting test. These dice are not allocated towards drain
tests for conjuring however.
