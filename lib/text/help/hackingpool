"HACKING POOL"

A Decker has a pool set aside specially for decking, or "hacking." The Hacking
Pool can be used to help succeed in any utility tests while jacked into the
^WMatrix^n, but not for any defensive utilities. The pool is equal to the
Decker's ^WIntelligence^n plus their MPCP, divided by three.
