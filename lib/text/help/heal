HEAL

Usage: ^gHEAL <target> <damage Level>^n

This command uses an adepts empathic healing power to heal a target
of physical wounds by transfering them to the adept. The target must
be lying down or unconcious and the adept must be able to physically
touch them. An adept cannot take more damage from a target than he could
otherwise sustain without becoming mortally wounded.
