"IMPROVED ATTRIBUTES"

This power adds its rating to one of the users physical attributes.
It is a permenant addition and is used when calculating karma costs
for increasing attributes. Also, when the base rating plus the improved
rating is more than the racial modified limit it costs a whole power
point instead of only a half.
