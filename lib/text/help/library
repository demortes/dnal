"HERMETIC LIBRARY"

Hermetic libraries come in two types, conjuring and sorcery. Conjuring libraries,
along with hermetic circles, are used by a hermetic mage to summon elementals.
Sorcery libraries are used by mages to create and learn spells.
Hermetic libraries can either be physical libraries, which require a great amount
of space to set up, or electronic, which must be installed on a desktop computer.
