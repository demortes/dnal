LODGE

Lodges are where a Shaman performs powerful magic. They are bound to the
shaman that created them and are dedicated to that shamans totem. Any
shaman inside a lodge is protected by an astral barrier equal to the force
of the lodge.
Only one lodge or hermetic circle can be present in a room at any given time.
