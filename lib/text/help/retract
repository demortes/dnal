RETRACT

Usage: ^gRETRACT^n

This command is used to extend and retract any retractable cyberweapons
you have. While they are retracted they are not visible except to people
who assense you and any combat will use your fists and deal stun damage
(Not counting if you have bone lacing). Once they are extended you will
use them in any hand to hand combat, using the Cyber Implants skill.
