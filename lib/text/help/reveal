REVEAL

Test: None
Utility: None
Usage: ^gREVEAL^n

This command lowers your detection factor momentarily and broadcasts your
position to other deckers in the host. This is useful if you have a meeting
in the matrix with another decker and need them to be able to spot you. It
has no affect on matrix security.
