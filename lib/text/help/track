TRACK

Usage: ^gTRACK <object>
       TRACK <person> spell <number>
       TRACK <person> <object>
       TRACK^n

This command is used to begin astrally tracking an astral signature on either
a spirit, spell, foci, lodge or hermetic circle. After you spend some time
performing it, it will locate the person who created the signature and take you
to them. While tracking the only action that can be performed is the track action.
Typing track by itself will halt the tracking, and type track on its own again will
resume. Remember, it is possible to die from essence loss while tracking, so if 
you feel your body starting to slip away it would be a good idea to try again at
a later time.
