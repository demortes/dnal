Awakened Worlds is a Shadowrun RP MUD. It is not a mush or mux, it does not
shut people out for choosing a type of character, if it is well within
the confines of Shadowrun Third Edition, and if our code has features to
support this type of character out of character generation.

Awakened Worlds's rules, RP positions, and gamemaster decisions are on the terms
of the Awakened Worlds staff. Your only right when signing onto this mud is the
right to close your mud client window and not come back.

Awakened Worlds's staff will not tolerate under any circumstances, badgering
or bullying other players out of character.

You are here on our terms.  If you disagree with our terms, disconnect now.

Welcome to Awakened Worlds.
