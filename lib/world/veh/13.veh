These days, Ford isn't best known for the lavish interiors, in fact it makes
you think of a toned-down pick-up truck. But for all the pseudo-hill-billyness

doesn't generate much noise or heat, it's easily the runner's car of choice.

ShortDesc:	a Rhiati Razor motorcycle
RoomDesc:	A heavy bodied 'chopper' styled motorcycle is parked here.
LongDesc:$
The Rhiati handles the road with insanely smooth accuracy, creating a ride, as
one would say that is "like buttah"...  Tir Tairngire engineering from the
Rhiati corporation, the automotive wing of Telestrian Industries Corporation.
Everything on the riding end is designed for pure comfort on the road, from
the handle grips to the seat.  For the hardcore motorcycling enthusiast, a
switch exists which allows you to toggle electric ignition or the more
'classic' kick-starting. 
~
Inside:$
A ride like a dream, with speed to match.  The Rhiati Razor handles like a
surgeon's blade, operating with to-the-millimeter precision on the road.  And
it doesn't lose any handling when taken up to insane racing speeds, it just
weaves around traffic as if it were walking through an obstacle course.

The Rhiati Arrow, designed by the Rhiati Corporation, TIC's automotive
subsidiary, is a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants speed demon motorcycle of elven
design.  Rhiati has spared no expense in creating the most efficient, yet
insanely quick racing bike that can be put together. 
~
Inside:$
Though not an entirely comfortable ride, it is an amazingly fast ride,
outperforming many, if not most other bikes of its class.  It is picking up
popularity amongst the Ancients go-gangs inside Tir Tairngire, though it has
yet to take off abroad.  Its very fast, and picks up almost instantaneously.

ShortDesc:	a Rhiati Destion limousine
RoomDesc:	A sleek, elegant, high-tech limousine is parked here.
LongDesc:$
The signature limo of the Tir Tairngire corporate elite, the Rhiati Destion is
only made in limited number, which is the reason for the lofty pricetag.  This
is the limousine that the Council of Princes use on official business within
the country.  The Destion is as state of the art as state of the art gets, but
is very elf-centric, with all messages inside the vehicle completely in
Sperethiel.  The technology used is completely parallel with other
ultra-highclass limousines such as the Phaeton, even superior in some
respects, such as the precision engineering. 
~
Inside:$
This limousine is packed to the gills with technology for comfort and
convenience, as well as creature comforts such as a full wet bar, wide screen
trideo, and a Jacuzzi in the back.  The stereo system plays music to haunting
acoustic perfection that borders on the supernatural, and the plush seating is
princely.  The computer messages and the audio notifications are all in
Sperethiel, making it clear to the rider or driver that this limo was intended
for an elven user.  There is a refrigerator on board as well, and a shoe-shine
machine, and a top of the line DIR-X simsense machine.

LongDesc:$
This vectored-thrust drone is small enough for indoor use, yet sturdy enough
for outdoor applications. This flexibility is one of the many virtues of the
Ares design, turning the Guardian into a mainstay of rigger-based security
systems. While some critics have claimed that the Guardian is underpowered and
difficult to control, its ability to provide controlled small arms fire in any
situation can't be underestimated.
