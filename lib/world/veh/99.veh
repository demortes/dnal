Name:	fat hawg harley chopper
ShortDesc:	A Fat Hawg(tm) Harley Davidson chopper
RoomDesc:	A "Chopper" style motorcycle is parked here.
LongDesc:$
This bike is very large, built for a troll or somebody who is more adventurous
than your standard biker.  Powerful V-Twin engines roar when driven, making
windows rattle nearly a kilometer away.  Definitely a bike for a mad troll
biker.

Inside:$
Man, this fucker vibrates under you, and the power tears into the concrete as
you peel down the road.  This is not a bike for sissies, not by a long-shot.
