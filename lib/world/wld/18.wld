   Sculpted onto the surface of the wall is a delicate depiction of the events
that unfolded that tragic night in 2039.  On this particular section, there is
a scene of the surviving metahumans' escape into the sewer system.  Although
it is rumored that the orks prevented the elves from escaping that night, this
scene shows all four metatypes fleeing together.

#1828
Name:	The Crying Wall
Desc:$
   Not so long after the Night of Rage, metahumans cleared the site that
contained the burned ruins of the waterfront warehouses, and erected the
Crying Wall in its place.  At first glance, it would be hard to discern that
this place, so green with grass and flowers, and flooding with visitors, was
where the massacre had taken place.

   You stand at the foot of a large ramp, that slopes downwards, further down
towards a massive steel dome, closed off on all sides. Other than the shining
metal sides, you have no idea what could be contained inside.
