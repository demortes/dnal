Name:	W. Anselm and Cambridge Drive
Desc:$
   West Anselm Street meets with Cambridge Drive, a rather inconsequential
road just one step above an alleyway.  A brand new streetlight has been put up
here, with GridGuide functionality, and small cameras running with an SK to
photograph traffic violations and send them to your friends at Lone Star
Security Services.  Surrounding you is the city of Tacoma.  Tacoma is a suburb
built on the memory of pain.  Modern times have not ignored it, for there are
skyscrapers and shadowrunners, integration, and the influence of the
megacorporations.  But while Downtown Seattle is an overwhelming chemistry of
race and culture, and Portland is a polarized city of well-to-do noble elves,
and the proletariat, just clawing for what they can get to survive, Tacoma is
unified.  There are many historical sites that keep the notorious Night of
Rage alive, as well as holidays set aside for certainly the most respectable.

Name:	W. Anselm Street and Lambert Avenue
Desc:$
   This is the oldest part of town, largely blighted buildings, brick
warehouses torn down by ages of weather, and graffiti, line the streets.  To
the north are the shipyards, and a public pier where the Seattle/Tacoma Ferry
docks.  On the south end of Lambert, old, but well-kept Victorian Era
buildings line the street, contrasting the decaying warehouses.

   The blue-collar quality of this section of town remains, as the streets are
lined with older-style tenements, covered in gang graffiti, and populated by
shipyard workers and their many ganger children.  A thick aroma of something
nasty is in the air, almost dung-like, but with an acidic thread to the scent.
The Tacoma Aroma.  To the east is a thrift store, with a faded sign, reading
"Crossworlds".

   Partially-constructed office buildings line this portion of the street, as
the planned creation of a corporate sector in this area continues. Anselm
Street stretches several blocks westward, and a couple of blocks east, where
it ends at a Stuffer Shack, only to begin again on the other side of Athens as
East Anselm Street.

   This dimly and garishly lit hovel is one in a chain of stores providing
access to simsense and trideo entertainment. There is a large amount of
simsense, much of it in a lurid vein, but the trideo is both scant and
out-of-date. The neighborhood is simply too unstable (and poor) to support a
large quantities of trideo.

Desc:$
   There appears to be a great variety of simsense entertainments at first
glance, but upon inspection it becomes clear there are many repeats and
sequels. The great majority of titles are disturbingly violent fantasies in
which power is amassed by killing or maiming hordes of people.  Simsense
pornography, which at one time dominated sales, was outlawed in Seattle in
2047 and can only be accessed through the black market.

   With print and celluloid virtually dead, trideo has become the favorite
realm for popular art to inhabit. Simsense is lived; trideo is watched, albeit
in three dimensions.  It is therefore a less private experience and tends to
be more conventional in its trappings; trideos typically tell a story.

   West Anselm comes to an abrupt end at a block of brick buildings, one of
which directly east has a storefront on the lower floor, the omnipresent
Stuffer Shack.  The brick and concrete buildings are defaced with ornate
graffiti, with several gang slogans, all of which Rovers gang related.
Marquez runs north to south here, one leading to Main Street which is the main
thoroughfare for the north end of Tacoma, but hardly a main street in any real
sense of the word.  South of here is an onramp onto Interstate 5, the true
main thoroughfare of the western North American seaboard.

   North Main, despite its name, runs from east to west through the northern
edge of Tacoma.  Any farther north, and beyond the buildings that line the
north side of this street, you reach swamplands where nothing can be built.
Nonetheless, this is a busy street, though hardly anything like a main street,
it still sees a bit of traffic and commerce.  Cement walls on the sides of the
street are covered with sprawling white graffiti, the work of the Rovers gang
that claims West Tacoma.  On the north side of the street is a clean, somewhat
large building, the Velasquez Securities and Investments building.

   Interstate 5 runs through here pretty much straight on an east to west
path.  Along side the freeway are a smattering of tenements and apartment
complexes of a poor to working class variety.  Billboards advertising
everything from stock options to Crazy Lemmy's Used Cars line the freeway.

   To the north of here is an offramp to Little Road.  Looking northward you
see areas that were badly ravaged some time ago by the Night of Rage, and have
seen very little renovation.  A neon sign north of here with the flashing word
"^MHOTEL^n" catches your eye.  Beyond that are a smattering of fire scorched
tenements probably slumlorded over the years and barely patched up after the
rioting of that infamous night.
