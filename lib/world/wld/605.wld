Name:	Welcome to Awakened Worlds!
Desc:$
    Welcome to Awakened Worlds. This room stands on the event horizon of a great
rift, the rift connecting our world to that which lies beyond. You stand now
at the sole entrance to this realm. As you explore these hallowed halls, you
will discover everything you need to know to survive in the cruel, cold world
the Earth has become in what is our present - midway through the 21st century.
Mind you, here you will only be taught the theory of what you must do. Living
long enough to learn how to apply it is completely up to you. Welcome, and
good luck.
    Type NORTH or N to continue on your journey.

Desc:$
   A MUD is a virtual world. To look around this world, just type 'look' or
'l' for short. This will give you the description of the area you are in and
show any objects, people, and/or monsters in the same area.  If you use the
look command right now you will see this room description again.  You can look
at objects, people, monsters, and even in directions (such as 'look south' or
'l s' for short).  In order to move around the world, you type in the name of
the direction you wish to travel, such as north, south, east, west, up, or
down.  If there is not a path in that direction, the mud will let you know.
To continue, go north (by typing 'north' or 'n').  To see who or what else is
in the rooms adjacent to your own room, type 'scan'. Sometimes doors or
objects can obstruct your view or path. In that case, try to 'open' a door by
typing 'open door (direction)'.

Desc:$
   The next thing you need to know is how to find out information about
yourself.  There are several commands which give you information needed to
play here.  These commands are 'score', 'inventory', 'equipment', 'skills',
and 'spells'.  All commands on the mud may be abbreviated, therefore you can
type 'sc' for score, 'i' for inventory, 'eq' for equipment, and so on. The
first thing you should do is try out these commands.  To pick up an item you
see on the floor, type 'get (item)'. If the item is in a container, you can
type 'get (item) (container)' to retrieve it. If you'd like to equip the item,
simply type 'wear (item)'.

   The Shadowrun universe is set in the year 2060, when international
corporations have a strong grasp on the power in the world, surpassing the
authority of whole nations. The long lost practices of magic have also
emerged, creating a large variety of metahuman races in addition to returning
the forces of magic to the world. Awake allows you to interact with this
fantasy world through your CHARACTER- your avatar in the Shadowrun Universe.
You control this character, and act as if you were actually in this world.
This section of the tutorial will allow you to customize your character by

Name:	The Path of the Mundane
Desc:$
   So you weren't born with magical abilities. Who needs 'em? Mundanes can
augment themselves with cyberware and bioware, artificial enhancements, to
greatly increase their physical and mental capabilities. Mundanes also can
excel at tasks mages and Adepts can't- rigging vehicles and hacking into the
Matrix, the virtual reality system of computers, for example. Cyberware
detracts from the character's essence, representing the loss of humanity of a
character after installing foreign, unnatural objects into their bodies.
Cyberware and bioware may not be for everybody, as cyberware installation is a
sickening process. For those who can stomach it, however, the possibilities
are great. Continue WEST to learn more.

their minds into the computers themselves through machines called CYBERDECKS
and DATAJACK cyberware.
   RIGGERS- The futuristic mechanic, RIGGERS can synchronize their mind with
those of vehicles, effectively controlling vehicles and drones with their
VEHICLE CONTROL RIGS and REMOTE CONTROL DECKS. Riggers can become quite
formidable with a legion of machines backing them up.

Like all awakened beings however, their powers are hampered by cyberware and

Desc:$
   Following the Awakening in 2019, the world experienced a surge of magical
energy. In addition to the emergence of metahuman races such as elves,
dwarves, and trolls, mankind once again became capable of manipulating magical
energy from the Earth. Two divisions of mages formed: Hermetic Mages, who view
magic as a science and approach it in a scientific manner, and Shamans, who
consider magic to be more spiritual in nature. In Shadowrun, mages are capable
of casting spells, conjuring spirits or elementals to aid them, and also
astral projection, which will be explained later in the tutorial.

Desc:$
   Hermetic Mages consider magic to be like a science: because they know spell
formulas and are capable of managing the complex computations in their heads,
Hermetics usually consider magic to be theirs to use and manipulate. Hermetics
are capable of conjuring elementals, if they have access to a hermetic library
and various conjuring materials. The strength of the earth, fire, wind, or
water elemental depends on the force of the library used, and the abilities of
the summoner. Hermetic mages are also capable of astral projection and
perception.

Name:	Conjuring
Desc:$
   Conjuring is different for hermetic mages and shamans. Shamans can conjure
a spirit anywhere, but they will disappear at sunrise or sunset. Mages require
hermetic circles and conjuring libraries, but their elementals can wait in the
metaplanes for aslong as the mage desires and be called out at any time to
help.
   Spirits are ordered to perform services with the ORDER command, most orders
take up a service, once a spirits services run out they will vanish never to
be seen from again. If a spirit is disrupted (IE. Killed), it will vanish to
the metaplanes and be available to be summoned back again if conjured by a
hermetic mage.
   Spirits can be CONTESTed by other mages, hermetic mages can only contest
elementals and shamans can only contest nature spirits. Contesting control of
a spirit or elemental will let you take control of it if you are succesfull.

immediate surroundings. If they were in a forest, for example, they could
conjure up a Forest spirit. Likewise, if they were in the mountains they could
conjure a Mountain Spirit, or if they were in the city streets they could
summon a Spirit-of-Man. Shamans are also capable of astral projection and
perception. All Shamans must abide by the rules set forth by  their Totem.
Failure to obey the Totem, or deviation from the Totem philosophy,  will
result in the loss of magic abilities by the Shaman.

Name:	Spellcasting
Desc:$
   The two main commands that mages of either type will use the most is
CONJURE and CAST. Take your time to read the help files now.  There are alot
of factors that affect casting success, depending on your condition and the
spell being cast. Some spells are dependant on their victims stats, set
targets, or even their essence (Most health spells follow this). There are 3
types of spells, Instant, which effects happen as soon as you cast them;
Sustaining, which will stay in affect for as long as you concentrate; and
Permanent, which require you to concentrate for a set period of time before
the affects can not be undone.
   Concentrating on a spell distracts you from other tasks, and if it's not
being sustained by a spirit or focus (explained later) it will cause you to
have a harder time doing things that require concentration.

Name:	Managing Your Bank Account: ATMs and Credsticks
Desc:$
   The world of 2060 is all about nuyen (the standard currency in thes world).
Managing your finances is an important aspect of running the shadows. People
who carry their life savings with them all the time tend to lose it very
quickly.
   Characters can store their funds in bank accounts. At an ATM, type BALANCE
to see how much money is in the account, DEPOSIT to deposit your funds, or
WITHDRAW to make a transaction.
   Credsticks, small pen shaped credit cards, are also a safe way to store
money. Credsticks can be personalized by someone to keep their funds safe, but
can also be rigged by someone who is proficient in ELECTRONICS. To personalize
a credstick, simply ACTIVATE it. If the credstick has already been activated,
you must CRACK the security with your ELECTRONICS skill before you can access
the nuyen within. You can use credsticks to make purchases, although some
illegal street dealers will only accept rolls of nuyen.
   To move funds from a credstick to an ATM, type "TRANSFER <amount> ACCOUNT".
To transfer funds from an ATM to a credstick, type "TRANSFER <amount>
CREDSTICK".

Name:	All About Radio Broadcasting
Desc:$
    The radios used by Shadowrunners in 2064 are specialized Matrix terminals
linked through the Shadowland network. This allows them heavy security from
most normal law enforcement agencies, but it is still possible to track
someone down through it.
   Radio's are an IN-CHARACTER form of communication: disregard the way you
behave and think about how your character would act.
   To operate a radio use the RADIO command. This will show you it's current
settings. To center the radio at a frequency (the most common is 8mhz), type
RADIO CENTER <frequency>. To scan through all frequencies type RADIO SCAN.
Encryption rating can be set by typing RADIO CRYPT <rating>. Only radios with
an encryption rating greater than or equal to what you have it set at can
receive them.
   To broadcast a message type BROADCAST <message>. Turning the radio off can
be accomplised with RADIO OFF.

Name:	Score Screen
Desc:$
   There are a few entries on the score sheet that may not be obvious.
   Karma is basically your experience in the world, you gain more by killing
other people and completing Shadowruns, how you go about this is up to you.
Your total karma is divided into two sections; Reputation, the karma gained
through performing Shadowruns and Immortal Awards; and Notoriety the karma
gained through killing. Reputation affects the maximums amount of PowerPoints
adepts can get, what Shadowruns you can do and other things, Notoriety affects
nothing.
   Essence Index is the amount of Bioware you can handle before you start
having negative affects, like slow healing, illness, etc. It is equal to your
Essence + 3. Essence is the amount of humanity you have left, or how well
attached your spirit is to your body, cyberware will reduce it. As your
essence drops so does your magic rating, and the amount that beneficial magic
will affect you. Bioware Index is the amount of Bioware your body can take,
bioware also reduces magic like cyberware, but only at half the value you have
installed.
   Awakened Characters also have a Grade, which is how many times they have
initiated, this is explained later.

Name:	Worlds Within our World: Facets of Reality
Desc:$
   In the world of Shadowrun, the physical world is just one of many facets of
reality. With the resurgance of magic and amazing advances in technological
development, whole new worlds have been opened up for the people of 2060.
Riggers can directly connect their minds with their vehicles, essentially
"becoming" their cars. Deckers can similarily connect their minds with
machines, specifically the artificial reality construct known as the Matrix.
The Matrix, a global connection of the world's computer systems, is a virtual
world that directly stimulates the senses of the Deckers enter use it through
technology called Simsense. Magically attuned characters like mages and Adepts
are also capable of interacting with the Astral Plane, a metaphysical realm
that mirrors the real world. Through the Astral Plane, mages can leave their
physical bodies and sense lifeforce and auras of all living things that they
come into contact with. Head on SOUTH to learn more about these worlds that
Awake has to offer.

Name:	The Astral Plane
Desc:$
   Awakened Character, Hermetic and Shamanic Mages and Adepts, have access to
the astral plane in some form. Aspected Mages and magicians can only perceive
the astral plane, while full mages can fully remove their spirit from their
bodies and explore the astral plane freely.
   PROJECT and PERCEIVE are used to perform these actions. To stop projecting
type RETURN, to stop perceiving toggle it off again with PERCEIVE. Astral
Perception makes concentrating on both the physical and astral planes
difficult and gives you penalties to any actions that involve concentration.
While projecting your essence will slowly decrease, at a rate of 1 per mud
hour. If it falls to 0 you will die. It returns at a rate of 1 every mud hour
while in your physical body however. There are various actions that can only
be undertaken while in the astral plane, these are explained to the WEST.

Name:	Decking: There is No Spoon
Desc:$
   Decking is a fairly complex art, almost a whole game unto itself. To
connect to the matrix, find a room that mentions a dataport and CONNECT. From
there you have a variety of options: You can LOCATE another host, then LOGON
to it. You can attempt to LOCATE files and DOWNLOAD them.
   But first you need a cyberdeck and four 'persona' programs - body, evasion,
sensors and masking. You must INSTALL these programs to access even the most
basic of hosts. Once you get started, you'll realise that a lot of operations
fail. To improve your chances of succeeding, you can add additional utilities
to your deck. Use the SOFTWARE command to get the values and names of software
you have installed.
    See the help files: MATRIX, IC, CYBERDECKS, PROGRAMS, UTILITIES, LOCATE,
LOGON, ANALYZE, DOWNLOAD, SOFTWARE and RUN for more information.

Name:	Rigging: Danger! Danger, Will Robinson!
Desc:$
   Rigging is a complex task. A rigger must aquire three things before they
can even think about rigging: a Vehicle Control Rig, and Datajack, and a
Remote Control Deck. Once those are aquired, they simply need to purchase a
vehicle or a drone. First the rigger must register the vehicle with the
SUBSCRIBE command to add it to their RC deck. When subscribed, a vehicle will
be given a control number. To start controlling a vehicle on your SUBSCRIBE
list, type CONTROL (number of the vehicle). To adjust the speed at which you
are travelling, type SPEED (idle/cruise/speeding/max). To return back to your
physical body, type RETURN. While in control of a vehicle, it is possible to
attack those who are hostile with the RAM function. Excessive ramming will
result in damage to the vehicle. If the vehicle is destroyed while the rigger
is in control of it, he will suffer extreme damage known as DUMPSHOCK, in
which his brain is wracked by the damage sustained while in control of the
vehicle. Weapons can also be attached to a drone, providing a safer method of
attack.

the street, where they will take heavy crash damage in addition to being in
the unenviable position of confronting whatever destroyed their vehicle. In
the world of 2060, the isolated city-state of Seattle is surrounded by
unfriendly nations, all of which firmly patrol their borders and shoot
intruders on sight. It is not recommended that you attempt to drive past a
border fortification.

   The man in this room also can sell a vehicle to you if you have the money
for one. He won't give you the actual car itself, but he will give you a TITLE
that you cash in for a vehicle at the end of the area. Driving isn't
essential, however, as Seattle boasts an effective cab system: simply type

   Doors can be locked and unlocked using the LOCK and UNLOCK commands,
directions or door names can be used as arguments. To "pick" a lock you use
the BYPASS command. To do this you need an electronics kit however.
   It is also possible to kick or shoot doors down, using the KICK or SHOOT

how long is remaining until an item arrives and to receive delivery of it.
   If an item has a time listed in the "Availibility" column then it is
subject to an availiblity test. The time listed is the least amount time it
will take, the better you score on the availiblity test the less time it will
take.
   Once ordered you can go about your business as normal, even log off, it
will be availible in the amount of time the shopkeeper responds. All time
listed is MUD time.

   A laser sight can be attached for those who do not have a smartlink for
increased accuracy.
   Gas Vents can reduce the recoil of a weapon, reducing the target modifiers
for firing in burst fire mode.

Name:	Entrance to the Neophyte Guild Combat Simulation
Desc:$
   This section of the Neophyte Guild will teach basic combat. Characters who
have high QUICKNESS, INTELLIGENCE, and REACTION will tend to get more attacks
than their opponents. To initiate combat, type KILL (target). If you are using
a weapon that deals stun damage, you will only stun your opponent instead of
killing them. Killing should only be initiated on MOBs (mobiles, computer
controlled non-player characters). All your kills with gain you a fraction of 
a karma point, but also increases your NOTORIETY. And don't even think about trying
to start a fight with another player unless you both have toggled your
player-killer flags- you won't do any damage at all, wheras your opponent will
be able to hurt you. Continue SOUTH to learn more about combat.

Name:	Melee Combat Tutorial
Desc:$
   This section will teach you about basic, same-room combat. When both
opponents are in the same room, you can initiate a fight with the KILL
command. If both characters are using melee weapons, they'll just duke it out.
Likewise, if both characters are using firearms, they'll take turns shooting
at each other. However, if one character is using a melee weapon and their
opponent has a firearm, they will need to "close the distance" before they can
try to attack their opponent. It is difficult to attack someone with a sword
if they happen to be spraying you with full automatic fire. Your success at
closing the distance between the attackers is dependant on your QUICKNESS
rating. As such, attrbitues like QUICKNESS, INTELLIGENCE, and WILLPOWER are
all very important for combat. BODY is also important for determining damage
resistance, and STRENGTH is useful for increasing the power of your attacks if
you're using a melee weapon.
   Combat can also be initiated in other ways: Casting a combat spell on
someone will start a fight, and casting spells in the middle of combat
requires intense concentration- the harder the spell, the longer it will take
to cast it.

Name:	Ranged Combat Tutorial: Distance Attacks
Desc:$
   Tested your basic combat abilities on those training robots? Now it's time
to learn about ranged attacks. If you're using a ranged weapon like a firearm,
you can attack people from other rooms. Type SCAN now to see WEST into the
Shooting Range. You can hit people in other rooms with the SHOOT command. To
fire at someone, type SHOOT (target) (direction). Naturally, it is more
difficult to shoot someone from far away than it is if they're in the same
room: gun accessories like smartlinks, laser sights, gas vents, and scopes can
make the task easier. If a mage has a direct line of sight, they can also cast
a combat spell from a distance. Type syntax is CAST '(spell)' (target)
(direction). The same can be done from Astral Space against an Astral form.
Practice ranged combat here if you want, and head SOUTH to learn more about
combat.

Name:	Advanced Combat Tactics: Tips for Survival
Desc:$
   Combat can be a difficult task. Thankfully, this section teaches you some
commands that can make survival easier. If you've gone in over your head and
started a fight with someone that you're losing, you can FLEE to try to run
away. Fleeing will attempt to move your character out of the room through a
random exit- you may escape the fight, or you may run into more opposition if
you're not careful. For a more precise, but more difficult method of escaping
combat, try to RETREAT. You can run away from a specific direction if you try
to RETREAT (direction). The WIMPY command can be used to set your character to
automatically flee once they're wounded enough. 
   What if you don't want to run away from a fight? To avoid getting hit, you
have a COMBAT POOL. Your COMBAT POOL is determined by your QUICKNESS,
INTELLIGENCE, and WILLPOWER attributes. In combat, your COMBAT POOL will add
dice to either your defense (allowing you to dodge attacks) or offense
(allowing you do deal more damage, or hit someone) dice rolls. To set your
combat pool, type DEFENSE.
   Wounds: The weapons in Shadowrun all have a set, realistic damage rating:
Light, Moderate, Serious, and Deadly. Based on the skill of your weapon
handling, you can increase the amount of damage you deal to an opponent. For
example, someone who is skilled enough with a Light weapon can make it deal
Moderate, Serious, or even Deadly damage if they're good enough. A weapon is
only as good as its user.

Name:	Inside Ricky's Kitchen
Desc:$
   Participating in Immortal-held Roleplaying Events, in combination with
Autojohnson Shadowruns, a character will earn Karma. Karma can be used to
increase character attributes and skills, provided the character can find
appropriate trainers and teachers outside of the Neophyte Guild. Karma is
divided into two values: Reputation is "good" karma that you earn from jobs
and events, Notoriety is "bad" karma that you gain by killing people. To
discourage power gaming, characters with too much notoriety (more than the
repuation value) will be given a Power Gaming flag on their characters, which
will significantly reduce their ability to carry out tasks like fighting.
There are plenty of Autojohnsons out there in the Seattle Metroplex, which
means there are plently of job opportunities for characters.

   Brand new characters should check out the Dantes Inferno nightclub for
quick, simple work to build their reputation in the shadows, and also to
develop contacts with other characters. To travel around the city, you can
HAIL a cab outside, get inside, and tell the driver where you want to go.

Desc:$
   Spirits are very dangerous in combat, especially to people without any
astral abilities. They have an immunity to physical weapons so can only be
effectively attacked in the astral plane. Mages can also BANISH spirits, any
mage can banish any spirit or elemental, even if they could not normally
control them.
   Banishing is dangerous to both parties however, as it can cause the mage to
temporarily lose magic, and if reduced to no magic, they may suffer permanent
magic loss.
   Any spirit that is banished is gone forever.

Name:	Aspected Mages
Desc:$
   Aspected Mages are people who have not fully awakened, they only have
access to part of the astral plane. Because of this no Aspected mage can
project, and they are very limited to what they can do with mage. Conjurers
can only conjure elementals and Sorcerers can only cast spells.
   Shamanists are a shaman only aspect, and they only have access to spells
and spirits that their totem gives them a bonus for.
   Elementalists are the most complex of the aspects, they are a purely
hermetic aspect. They can only cast spells and conjure spirits that correspond
to their element; Fire is Combat; Earth is Manipulation; Water is Illusion and
Air is Detection. No elementalist can cast Health spells.
   Aspected magicians can still astrally perceive and banish any spirit or
elemental.

Name:	Astral Projection
Desc:$
   Full Mages have complete access to the astral plane in the form of Astral
Projection. The mages leave their body behind and travel purely in spirit
form. This allows them to access areas they otherwise couldn't. When in astral
space, they can't interact with the physical plane in anyway, they are
completly non-corporal. Astral forms may MANIFEST though, which allows them to
be seen by people without astral vision, they can also be heard, though the
voice is purely in their head and can't be recorded.
   Only Mana based spells can be cast in astral space, and then, they can only
be cast on astral or dual beings, purely physical bodies cannot be targeted
from the astral plane. All drain taken in the astral plane causes physical
damage, regardless of force. You can also TRACK astral signatutes in the
astral plane.

Desc:$
   Foci are magical artifacts that help with spell casting. They can only be
used by a mage that has previously bonded them. The "HELP FOCI" file covers
them in more detail. Foci cost karma and time to bond, if you don't have
enough karma you will be told how much you need. Also, in Character Generation
you can bond Foci with Force Points.
   If you find a foci bonded by another mage, you can TRACK it back to its
owner with astral tracking or rebond it, which severes its link with its
previous owner and makes it usable by you.

Desc:$
   To further improve their abilities adepts must gain more power points.
There are two methods for this, initiation or buying them with karma.
Powerpoints cost an adept 20 karma, and only 1 can be bought for every 50
reputation they have. To buy one, ask any Immortal, they all have the ability
to award them to you. Initiation will be covered later as it affects all
awakened characters.

Name:	Adept Commands
Desc:$
   Adepts have a few commands to go along with their powers. The Nerve Strike
power can be toggled on and off using the NERVESTRIKE command. While toggled
on, the adepts hand-to-hand combat will do no damage, but follow rules for
Nerve Strike. if the adept is wielding anything Nerve Strike will not be
triggered.
   To use the Empathic Healing power the HEAL command is used, this requires a
target that is either lying down or unconcious. Pain relief uses the RELIEVE
command, and also requires a lying or unconcious target. Boosted attributes
are boosted by typing BOOST and then the name of the attribute that requires
boosting. Adepts with the Astral Perception power can also astrally perceiving
using the PERCEIVE command.

Name:	Armour
Desc:$
   There are two kinds of Armour in the world of Shadowrun; Ballistic and
Impact. Ballistic protects against bullets. Impact protects against slower
moving projectiles like arrows, fists, swords and explosions.
   Once more than one piece of armour is being worn at once a process known as
layering takes place. The highest rating piece of armour is applied in full,
then half the value of all other pieces is applied. The full total of all
pieces is used to calculate penalties though.
   If the unlayered value of your ballistic or impact armour values is greater
than your modified quickness you begin to experience penalties due to your
movement being restricted. You will move slower, lose combat pool, and have a
harder time using quickness based skills like athletics or ranged combat. Form
fitting armour is not included in the calculations for layering penalties
however.

Name:	Astral Actions
Desc:$
   Assensing is the process of carefully looking at the aura of a person,
spell or object and discerning otherwise unknown information from it. It can
be used to find out how much of a persons spirit remains in their body, the
location of any cyberware, who cast a spell and what force. Anything that is
magically active has an aura and so can be assenssed.
   ASSENSE is the command used to perform this action. People, foci, hermetic
circles, lodges, spirits and spells can all be assenssed for more information.
Infact you may wish to assense them before taking further action, so you don't
end up a big astral stain. The help file contains more information on the use
of this command.
   Astral Tracking is the process of taking a spell aura, and finding the
source. It can track anyone, anywhere in the world, aslong as you have an
astral link to them, this can be a spell they've cast, foci, a conjured
spirit, or even a shamanic lodge, anything they've left an astral signature
on. It takes time to TRACK someone, and if it takes more time than you can
stay projected due to essence loss you will have to resume again later.
